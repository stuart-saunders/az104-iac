# AZ-104 Labs
 
Repo to document the Infrastucture as Code developed during labs covering the AZ-104 syllabus.

Whilst the labs often cover the building of infrastructure using the portal, CLI or PowerShell, this repo will do this with IaC - usually Terraform.

Covers labs from Microsoft Learn and Whizlabs.com.
